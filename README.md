# Shotgun-Showdown
A command-prompt user input game based on Russian Roulette with the inclusion of a few items to spice up the game. I saw my friends playing a game called Buckshot Roulette. While watching them play, I realized that I could make the same game with my current programming knowledge. Ever since then I have been itching to make the game myself (all the core elements), and now that I am on Spring Break I finally have the time to create this game. Have fun playing it!

# How to play?
1. Download the full project
2. Compile and Run Main.java
3. Follow directions provided by game

# Motivation for the Creation of the Game
This short project took me about half of Spring Break to complete. The main motivation behind this project was to put the skills I had learned in CS 1331 Object-Oriented Programming and CS 1332 Data Structures and Algorithms to the test. In class, we learned theory and minimal viable products and I wanted to implement everything I learned in my first year of university into a single project.

- Leaderboard object implemented as a Max Heap
- AccountBank object implemented as a Linear Probing Hash Map
- Shotgun object implemented as an Array-Backed Queue
- ItemRack object implemented as an Array of Linked Lists
- Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Inheritance, Input/Output, and many other Object Oriented Programming topics.
